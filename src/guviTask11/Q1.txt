There Four access modifiers are:

 * Public 
 * Private
 * Default
 * Protected

Public :
Class - A public class is accessible from any other class in any package.
Method - A public method can be called from any other class in any package.
Variable -  A public variable can be accessed from any other class in any package.
Significance - The public modifier allows the widest access level.

Protected :
Class - Classes cannot be declared as protected. Only inner classes can use the protected modifier.
Method - A protected method can be called within its own package and by subclasses in other packages.
Variable - A protected variable can be accessed within its own package and by subclasses in other packages.
Significance - The protected modifier provides a more restricted access level compared to public, allowing access only within the same package and by inheritance.

Default :
Class - A class with no access modifier is package-private, meaning it is accessible only within its own package.
Method - A method with no access modifier is package-private, accessible only within its own package.
Variable - A variable with no access modifier is package-private, accessible only within its own package.
Significance - The default access modifier provides package-level access, making it accessible only to other classes in the same package.

Private :
Class - Classes cannot be declared as private. Only inner classes can use the private modifier.
Method - A private method can only be called within the same class in which it is declared.
Variable - A private variable can only be accessed within the same class in which it is declared.
Significance - The private modifier provides the most restricted access level, limiting access to the defining class only.
