Exception :
An Exception in Java represents a condition that a program should handle. It disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions.
Exceptions are generally caused by code within the program and are often recoverable.
Ex : NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, FileNotFoundException, etc.

Error :
An Error in Java represents a serious problem that a program should not try to handle. Errors are generally caused by external factors or the environment in which the program is running.
Errors are typically unrecoverable and indicate problems that are not caused by the program itself but by the system or its configuration.
Ex : OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError, VirtualMachineError, etc.
